My circuit isn’t working
• Is your power module switched on? The switches are tiny, and
sometimes people miss them. When turned on, there should be
an LED light on the power module that shines red.
• If you’re using a battery, does it need to be charged or replaced?
• Do you need to wipe your connectors? If there’s anything on the
connectors or the magnets, wipe it off with a soft, clean cloth.
An old t-shirt, fresh out of the laundry, is best.
• Do you need to clean your connectors? If any of the three
electrical connectors are oxidized (they’ll have dark deposits on
them) you can use some isopropyl alcohol on your soft, clean
cloth. Don’t use anything else to clean your modules – some
“electrical connector cleaners” have chemicals that can damage
the plastic part of the bitSnapTM
.

'll go step by step

Resetting your w6 arduino when Arduino IDE can't find your board.

DONE, EASY! Disconnect all bits from your w6 arduino. Connect a power bit directly to the w6 arduino. Make sure the power bit is not yet on.

DONE! Connect your w6 arduino to your compupter with a USB cable.

I OPENED 'BLINK' Open a sketch that you know works (i.e. not the most recent sketch that you uploaded that seems to have broken your w6 arduino). If you don't know of a known working sketch you can use littleBitsDemo.ino.

DONE, NO PROBLEMS! In Arduino IDE verify and make sure there are no errors in your code.

In Arduino IDE click upload and watch the blue status bar directly below your sketch and above the monitor.
THIS IS THE WINDOW THAT I GET....ERROR MESSAGE AT THE BOTTOM.

WITHOUT POWER TO THE DEVICE, I CANNOT SELECT THE PORT

IF I POWER UP WITHOUT ANY ATTACHMENT, JUST USING THE POWER BIT, IT EITHER LOCKS AS A MOUSE CLICK, OR SWINGS TO HARD TOP LEFT OR HARD BOTTOM RIGHT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF CONTROLS.

At first the status bar will say "Compiling sketch...". When the status bar changes to "uploading..." turn on the power to your w6 arduino.
You should receive a "Done uploading" status at which point your bit will be operational.

Thanks for having a look at it for me, I appreciate your help. smile
